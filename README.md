# CyberFresco
Quick and easy HTML image gallery creation.

Builds a complete set of thumbnails, webpages (with navigation), and indexes, for a folder (or folders) of images. C++ rewrite and major update.

Started in 2005, with the last release in 2008, this is a major update and rewrite.

Initial code is uploaded. Mostly functional, FTP uploading is not finished, lots of tweaks and QoL improvements to come.
